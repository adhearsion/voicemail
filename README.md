# Voicemail

This plugin aims to provide a basic voicemail implementation, complete with a voicemail system that allows user to listen to messages and manage them. It is currently only compatible with Asterisk, and you will need to provide the audio files and their path in the configuration. The configuration also contains many other options.

## Storage

Mailbox metadata is stored in a PStore hash on disk for easy drop-in functionality.
To implement your owm storage layer, look at the StorageMain class for method signatures.

## Usage

Every mailbox has an id and PIN that can be provisioned using a pry console.

To send a call to a mailbox use:
```ruby
  # inside a CallController method
  invoke Voicemail::VoicemailController, mailbox: mailbox_id
```

To allow access by users to the mailboxes, `invoke MailboxController`. You will have to provide the mailbox ID to load.
```ruby
  # inside a CallController method
  invoke Voicemail::MailboxController, mailbox: mailbox_id
```

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  * If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself so I can ignore when I pull
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
